# Wild-Swaying-Goats-Project

## Context
This is a capstone project from the University of Washington [Social Computing 
course](https://social.cs.washington.edu/cse481social/).

Online anonymity and rapid sharing allows misinformation to disseminate quickly and with little consequence 
to the people sharing it. Moreover, there are many different types of misinformation, including 
but not limited to: incomplete or biased information, and improper statistical figures.

Through our user study (consisting of participants mostly in their early 20s and in higher education) 
we were able to find that our users mostly care about getting easy and efficient access to information, 
trust well-known publications, and the majority only tend to lurk on online platforms.

Thus, our project Greatest Online Anti-misinformation Tables (GOAT) seeks to encourage users 
within online and offline discussion to be cautious about misinformation. Our platform encourages participants 
to utilize reliable sources and debate the validity of said sources.

[This project was bootstrapped with Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Setup

1. Install at least [Node.js version 16.14.0](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Ensure that you are using at least npm version 6.14.5 (npm 8.3.1 recommended). Note that npm should come with Node.js

2. Open your terminal and `cd` into the wild-swaying-goats-app directory

3. From this directory run `npm i` (npm install)

4. Next run `npm start`

A local version of the web application should pop up in the browser.

## Try out GOAT!

1. Pick a topic of interest from the landing page.
2. Review a source from both sides of the argument. We recommend clicking on the link and skimming the source.
3. Rate this source.
4. Try adding a new source to either side.
5. Next try adding a new Bibliography page.

## Future Improvements

We had ideas that could be implemented to improve GOAT:

- Search functionality to search the bibliography titles
- User login
- Allow users to see mutual friends voting on a source
- Popup if users have not clicked on a source link before voting
- Dynamic amounts of sides in an argument (e.g., having 3 sides)
- Add users to a [hypothesis.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) group when they click on links where they can annotate articles together
